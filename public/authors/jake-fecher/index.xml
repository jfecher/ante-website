      <description>Introduction Algebraic Effects are a useful abstraction for reasoning about effectful programs by letting us leave the interpretation of these effects to callers. However, most existing literature discusses these in the context of a pure functional language with pervasive sharing of values. What restrictions would we need to introduce algebraic effects into a language with ownership and borrowing - particularly Ante?1
 Ownership Consider the following program:
effect Read a with read : Unit -&amp;gt; a the_value (value: a) (f: Unit -&amp;gt; b can Read a) : b = handle f () | read () -&amp;gt; resume value This seems like it&amp;rsquo;d pass type checking at first glance, but we can easily construct a program that tries to use the same moved value twice:</description>

      <title>Achieving Safe, Aliasable Mutability with Unboxed Types</title>

      <description>This is part of Ante&amp;rsquo;s goal to loosen restrictions on low-level programming while remaining fast, memory-safe, and thread-safe.
 Background  When writing low-level, memory-safe, and thread-safe programs, a nice feature that lets us achieve all of these is an ownership model. Ownership models have been used by quite a few languages, but the language which popularized them was Rust. In Rust, the compiler will check our code to ensure we have no dangling references and cannot access already-freed memory (among other errors).</description>
