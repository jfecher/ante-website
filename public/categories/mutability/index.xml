      <description>This post is an exploration on some additional possible semantics for mutability (and immutability).
Introduction  In my first blog post I introduced &amp;amp;shared mut references as a way to achieve safe, shared mutability in a language with unboxed types. For those unfamiliar with them, I encourage you to start with the first blog post. As a brief summary though, I started with Rust&amp;rsquo;s system with owned mutable references which I referred to as &amp;amp;own mut, and added on &amp;amp;shared mut from there.</description>

      <description>This is part of Ante&amp;rsquo;s goal to loosen restrictions on low-level programming while remaining fast, memory-safe, and thread-safe.
 Background  When writing low-level, memory-safe, and thread-safe programs, a nice feature that lets us achieve all of these is an ownership model. Ownership models have been used by quite a few languages, but the language which popularized them was Rust. In Rust, the compiler will check our code to ensure we have no dangling references and cannot access already-freed memory (among other errors).</description>
