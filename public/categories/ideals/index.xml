      <description>A Vision for Future Low-Level Languages I&amp;rsquo;ve had this vision in my head for quite a while now on what code written in a low-level language could look like. This vision has shaped my design of Ante and although I&amp;rsquo;ve alluded to it before, I&amp;rsquo;ve never explicitly stated it until now.
Now, what makes a language low-level is a bit contentious. I&amp;rsquo;m using it here to describe a group of languages I have no better descriptor for: C, C++, Rust, and Zig, among others.</description>
